The research consists of irradiance forecast using satellite imagery on a timeframe of around 3 hours, focusing on 4 different locations in the brazilian territory.
The forecasted images are obtained with the use of the Optical Flow tool, available in the cv2 python library.
Feel free to use anything, improvement sugestions are highly appreciated.
